# MSc Data Science Project – Sustainability Reporting in Thailand

This repository contains the analysis code and notebooks for the MSc Data Science final project
at the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol).

## Project title
A Comparative Analysis of MAI-listed Companies with and without Sustainability Reporting:
Evidence on Accounting Performance and Market Valuation in Thailand

## Repository contents
- `Code_submission.ipynb`  
  Data preparation, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis  
  (Financial performance 2022–2023 and Market variables 2024)

- `ML_submission.ipynb`  
  Exploratory machine learning analysis, including:
  - Baseline classification
  - Logistic Regression with LOOCV
  - KMeans clustering and PCA visualisation

- `outputs/`  
  Tables and figures generated by the notebooks and used in the report

## How to run
1. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
2. Run all cells from top to bottom
3. Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib

## Notes
- Market variables are analysed for 2024 only due to data availability.
- Machine learning results are exploratory because of the small sample size (N = 10 firms).
